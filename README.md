## Technologies/Tools Used ##

  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Bootstrap

## Challenge & Solution ##

The biggest challenge in this project was making sure the that once the letters were guessed they couldn't be guessed again. I think my biggest issue was trying to complicate the process. Once I slowed down and took things one step at a time it became very clear how to solve this issue.
